stringMLST

Fast k-mer based tool for multi locus sequence typing (MLST) stringMLST is a tool for detecting the MLST of an isolate directly from the genome sequencing reads. stringMLST predicts the ST of an isolate in a completely assembly and alignment free manner. The tool is designed in a light-weight, platform-independent fashion with minimum dependencies.
